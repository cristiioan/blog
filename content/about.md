### Hi there,

My name is Cristian and I'm a kid from Romania, Europe. I created this blog to share my ideas, experiences and learnings about things that I care about, including:

- System administration
- Open source software
- Freedom(Any type of freedom)
- Privacy
- Security

This blog is a personal project and I'm not affiliated with any company or organization.
