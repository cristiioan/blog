### What is selfhosting?

Selfhosting is making your own cloud at home. It is really great since you don't have to pay for storage in google drive and other accounts just to access more functionality. And as a bonus you get all the customization possible, including custom domain.

### What about the pricing?

The price for selfhosting can be as low as a few bucks a month, but it is going to increase based on the electricity bill and then specs you need. Generally, it is much cheaper than paying for SASS on the long run.
Starting prices can vary as well but a minimal setup is around 100$.

### What do I need?

To selfhost, you need a few basic things:

- Internet connection(with dedicated ip if you wish to make it accessible outside your home network)
- A computer / PI that will run the software
- Domain(optional)

### What can I selfhost?

You can selfhost almost anything you wish, including

- email
- file storage
- chat
- game servers
- special software

### So, is it worth it?

Going back to the initial question( and the title of this article), it is hard to answer. Some will say that it is not worth it due to a huge list of reasons, including that you can expect to troubleshoot every few days a minor issue to losing data, while others will say that the bonuses make it worth it.

My opinion is that you should try doing it. Currently I selfhost some of the software I use and I'm planing to increase the percentage.
