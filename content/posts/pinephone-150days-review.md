## Pinephone 150days Review

I had my PinePhone from the start of Octomber last year and I used it as my primary phone.

### What is the PinePhone?

The PinePhone is an open source linux phone made by Pine64. Is one of the most popular linux phones, with probably the most active community in the linux phones space.

### Is is daily driving yer?

No and yes, with a much bigger no. It really depends on the apps you need, but as long as you don't do the following on yout phone:

- Banking (It might be possible in Waydroid or using a web app, but I'm not sure)
- Video Calling
- Gaming (There is still a few games, including Chess and Gnome Sudoku )
- Watching lots of media.
- Using android apps that you can't ditch ( There is still waydroid, but it is not perfect)
