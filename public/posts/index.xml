      <description>What is selfhosting? Selfhosting is making your own cloud at home. It is really great since you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay for storage in google drive and other accounts just to access more functionality. And as a bonus you get all the customization possible, including custom domain.
What about the pricing? The price for selfhosting can be as low as a few bucks a month, but it is going to increase based on the electricity bill and then specs you need.</description>
